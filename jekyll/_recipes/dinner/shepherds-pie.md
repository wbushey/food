1. Brown the lamb. Do not use oil - the meat's fat is enough.
2. Chop onion.
3. Saute onion in butter.
4. Add lamb, herbs, pepper, and flour to onions. Cook for 3 -4 minutes.
5. Cover with beef stock and simmer for 30 minutes.
6. Meanwhile peel, chop and boil the potatoes for 20 minutes until cooked.
7. Once the meat is cooked, skim off the excess fat, then boil rapidly to 
   reduce the liquid until it just covers the meat and onions.
8. Drain the potatoes very well until completely dry. Mash until smooth and
   free of any lumps.
9. Add butter to the mashed potatoes, taste and adjust the seasoning. Add
   enough milk to make the mash very soft.
10. Put meat mixture in a shallow oven proof dish.
11. Spread the mash on top of the meat and brush the tops of the potatoes with
    melted butter.
12. If desired, sprinkle the grated cheese on top of the mash.
13. Spike the top with a fork.
14. Cook in a hot oven for about 30 - 50 minutes until the top is golden brown.
15. Serve with peas and beans.
