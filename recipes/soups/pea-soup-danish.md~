0. Prep: dice onion, celery, carrot, celery root.
1. Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium high heat. Add the chopped onions and saute until golden, about 15 minutes.
2. Add the next 6 ingredients, through thyme, and half of the dill. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer over medium low heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until peas are soft and soup is fragrant.
3. Meanwhile, saute the sliced onions in a skillet over medium high heat until crispy. Remove from skillet and set aside for topping.
4. Season soup with salt and pepper. Serve topped with crispy onions and fresh dill.

Notes: I didn't use celery root and it was fine.
