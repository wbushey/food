1. Salt the cubes of beef on all sides. Wait a few minutes (discuss the looming
   Writer's Guild of America contract strike and soberly sip green tea). 
2. Chop garlic. Peel and chop onions. Peel and chop potatoes. Slice carrots and
   celery.
3. Make beef broth
4. While making beef broth, saute onions and garlic in olive oil.
5. Brown the beef cubes on all sides in olive oil on medium-high heat to sear 
   in the flavor, using long tongs to turn the pieces. 
6. Put all ingredients in the Crock Pot. Stir. Cover.
7. Let cook for 4 to 5 hours on high, or 8 on low.
