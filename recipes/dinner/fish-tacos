1. Chipotle aioli: mix mayo, garlic, adobo, lemon juice. I like to use half a real lemon, or 1 tsp-1 tbsp lemon juice. 
   If you use the adobo with chipotles, be warned that using the actual peppers will make it much spicier. I like to just use the sauce.
   If you make this ahead of time and let it sit, the garlic mellows out and the flavors blend more.
2. Coleslaw: combine cabbage, cilantro, salt, pepper in a bowl, stir to combine. Refrigerate.
3. Fish: combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and mix. Rub the mixture on the fish. 
   Heat olive oil in a skillet on med-high heat, cook 3-4 min per side or until fish flakes easily with fork.
4. Prepare tortillas- we like to use corn so we heat them in some oil on a skillet
5. Fill tortillas with fish and cole slaw, top with aioli, avocado, and salsa. Squeeze a lime wedge over the mixture.
